Answering the question of just how hard it would be to build a MFWitches app.

## notes
* Assumes the app just lists news media places to avoid, complete with a simple search filter.
* Filtering done client side (just being lazy and reusing code) but could be handled by API.
* I believe using MFWitches logo and name as part of a mock app are covered under satire exemption but happy to remove if my (non-legal) opinion is not correct.
